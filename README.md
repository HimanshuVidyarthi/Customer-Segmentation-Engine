# Customer Segmentation Engine

## Project Overview

The **Customer Segmentation Engine** project uses data-driven techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, and other relevant features. By grouping customers into distinct segments, businesses can target marketing efforts more effectively, personalize product recommendations, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to **segment customers** into meaningful groups, allowing businesses to tailor their strategies to each group. Key features in the dataset may include:

- **Demographics** (e.g., age, gender, income level)
- **Purchase History**
- **Customer Lifetime Value**
- **Geographic Location**

Using these features, the project clusters customers based on shared characteristics, helping businesses understand their diverse customer base.

## Business Implications

Customer segmentation is essential for businesses aiming to improve customer retention, boost engagement, and drive sales. By understanding customer segments, businesses can allocate resources more efficiently and enhance overall marketing effectiveness.

## Data Analysis Techniques Used

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Univariate Analysis**: Examines the distribution of individual features to gain insights.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explores relationships between two variables to identify patterns in customer data.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Ensures completeness of data for accurate clustering.
- **Encoding Categorical Features**: Prepares data for clustering by converting categorical variables to a numerical format.

## Machine Learning Models Used

### K-Means Clustering

- Groups customers into clusters based on similar characteristics, aiding in identifying customer segments.

### Hierarchical Clustering

- Forms clusters by creating a tree-like structure, useful for understanding customer relationships and hierarchies.

## Model Evaluation Metrics

- **Silhouette Score**: Measures the quality of clusters by evaluating how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
- **Inertia**: Measures the sum of squared distances of samples to their nearest cluster center, helping assess the compactness of clusters.

## Major Takeaways

- **Customer Segmentation with Clustering**: Gained experience using K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for customer analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing and Encoding**: Learned techniques to handle and prepare customer data for clustering models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Understood how to assess clustering quality using metrics like Silhouette Score and Inertia.
